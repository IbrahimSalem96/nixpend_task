# Time Management Application

Our project is a project and task management tool that helps in improving productivity and organizing work. The project focuses on helping teams and individuals organize and manage their time and tasks effectively. The project includes several key features:

1. **Time Management:** Users can create projects and set time schedules for their tasks. Target dates can be set for completion of tasks and projects, which helps in setting priorities and urgent tasks.
